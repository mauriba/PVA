\section*{Abstract}
Performing aggregation and visualization on large datasets has become a major part in Information Technology.
Such datasets are often exported by a third party software or service provider, and arrive in a transmittable
format like JSON or CSV.
This term paper compares the grouping operation on large CSV files between PowerShell's
\verb+Group-Object+ command and MySQL's \verb+GROUP BY+ statement in regards of
their interface, underlying algorithm and RAM usage. On two identical machines
limited in RAM, we simulate how PowerShell's and MySQL's grouping operations perform. As a result,
we formulate best practices for aggregating large CSV files.
