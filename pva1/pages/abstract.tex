\section*{Abstract}
Performing aggregation and visualization on large datasets has become a major part of Information Technology.
Such datasets are often exported by a third party software or service provider, and arrive in a transmittable
format like \gls{JSON} or \gls{CSV}.
This term paper compares the grouping operation on large \gls{CSV} files between PowerShell's
\verb+Group-Object+ command and \gls{MySQL}'s \verb+GROUP BY+ statement in regards of
their return value, underlying algorithms and memory usage. Within two docker containers
limited in \gls{RAM}, we simulate how PowerShell's and MySQL's grouping operations perform. As a result,
we formulate best practices for aggregating large \gls{CSV} files.

\textbf{Keywords}: \gls{DB}, Aggregation, Grouping, \gls{CSV}
